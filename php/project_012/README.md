# Project 012: Include & Require

## Description
Split code into two files and include one in the other.

## Learning Goals
- Use `include` and `require`
- Understand include paths

## Code
See [greetings.php](greetings.php) and [index.php](index.php)

## Logic & Explanation
`greetings.php` defines a function. `index.php` uses `require_once` to load it and calls the function.
